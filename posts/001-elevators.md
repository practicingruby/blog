Next time you're waiting in a lobby somewhere, remember this fun bit of trivia: In the United States alone, there are 18 billion passenger trips via elevator per year, traveling a total distance that's equal to six round trips to our Sun and back.

Once you board the elevator, you will undoubtably be filled with such a deep sense awe that you will fall to the floor and weep tears of pure joy at the engineering marvel that stands before you. Elated and fully engaged, you will ride the elevator up and down for a full hour before giving even a single thought to where it was you needed to go. You will have found a suitable home away from home, a proper shrine to the engineering gods who also brought us fire, clothing, and sliced bread.

Just kidding! If you set that ridiculous fantasy aside, the following is a more believable description of what will happen the next time you ride one of these miraculous people movers: You'll press a button, wait 15 seconds, step inside the elevator, press another button, wait 30 seconds, step out of the elevator, and then be on your way without ever consciously thinking about the fact that you used a high tech mode of transportation at all. The chances are great that this particular elevator trip will be the same as nearly every other elevator trip you've taken in your entire life, no matter where in the world you are, and no matter what kind of building you are in. And this, my dear elevator-riding friend, is the real thing to be impressed about.

If this little anecdote has captured your interest, please take a moment now to ponder the following human-computer interface design quiz: 

1. What it about most elevator rides that make them so uneventful for us?

2. What bad things can happen to force us to pay attention to an elevator ride? (Yes, the elevator can burst into flames, but think of more subtle issues than that)

3. What kinds of design decisions can help mitigate the likelihood of a passenger having a bad elevator riding experience?

4. If you assume that you can't change the way humans interact with elevators, what opportunities and limitations are there in trying to improve elevator performance through software?

5. What fundamental assumptions do humans have about how elevators work?

6. What similarities are there between the challenges of creating a good experience for elevator riders and creating a good experience for visitors to a website?
